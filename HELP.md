# Design Patterns in Spring Boot

This project demonstrates the implementation of various **design patterns** in real-world use cases such as payments, algorithms, and transactions using **Spring Boot**. The goal is to provide practical examples of how design patterns can be applied to solve common software design problems.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
1. **Showcase Design Patterns**: Demonstrate how classic design patterns (creational, structural, and behavioral) can be applied in real-world scenarios.
2. **Provide Practical Examples**: Offer clear, working examples of design patterns in action, such as:
    - **Payments**: Handling different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal) using the **Strategy Pattern**.
    - **Algorithms**: Managing algorithm execution with the **Template Method Pattern**.
    - **Transactions**: Processing and validating transactions using the **Command Pattern** and **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**.
3. **Serve as a Learning Resource**: Help developers understand how to effectively use design patterns in a Spring Boot application.
4. **Encourage Best Practices**: Promote clean, maintainable, and scalable code by applying proven design principles.

By exploring this project, you will gain insights into how design patterns can simplify complex problems, improve code reusability, and enhance the overall architecture of your applications.
